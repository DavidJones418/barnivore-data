The four-year barrel-aging process gives our whiskey vanilla, caramel, citrus, and honey flavors but there is not actually honey in 2 GINGERS. \r\nI hope this helps! I apologize for the earlier confusion.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (July 2012):\r\n\"Although 2 GINGERS whiskey is not vegan (there is a hint of honey), it is a gluten-free product. It is made at the Cooley Distillery in Ireland, and there it is aged in barrels sourced from Heaven Hill, Tennessee. Most of those barrels once contained bourbon (which gives our whiskey vanilla and caramel notes) and a small portion of the blend is aged in sherry barrels.\"",

We brew all the beer onsite in Southwold but we can currently only package cask beer, so bottle, can and keg are sent out for filtration and packaging.\r\n \r\n\"We do use Isinglass in all the cask beer on site. We are involved in trialling some vegan finings but the results so far aren\u2019t good so I don\u2019t think this situation will change soon.\r\n \r\n\"The vast majority of our beer is bottled at Martsons in Burton on Trent. They do use Isinglass as part of the regular filtration process. They can, on request, filter without Isinglass but they will only do this with low volume beers as it impacts their capacity, we do brew two beer for M&S which don\u2019t use Isinglass, M&S Suffolk bitter and M&S Christmas ale.\r\n \r\n\"All our Canned beer is treated with Isinglass or could be to deal with any process issues.\r\n \r\n\"Our kegged beer is similarly treated,. However we are in the middle of a project that will mean we will be able to filter beer on site and keg it here from July. We are hoping that we will be able to process some of our keg beer without the use of Isinglass. I can\u2019t say for certain yet as all beers are different but it is our intention to do trials in June when the equipment is in place.\r\n \r\n\"It\u2019s also worth adding in the spirits. We produce Gin, Vodka and whisky, amongst other spirits here. None of these use animal products in the distillation.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (March 2014):\r\n\"All our spirits are vegetarian/vegan friendly at this time.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (June 2012):\r\n\"All our cask beers and bottled beers contain isinglass. Our beer is all made here in Southwold by ourselves so the processing would always be the same. The Cask Diamond Jubilee Ale we produced contained Honey.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email, January 2012:\r\n\"None of Adnams ales are suitable for vegans.\"\r\n\r\n[clarification question asked] \r\n\"I am saying that \u2018all\u2019 Adnams drinks are not suitable for vegans; ie beers & spirits.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (circa 2011)\r\n\"Currently, only one of our beers is suitable for vegans (i.e no isinglass finings are used) and that's bottled Spindrift.\"",

They weren't advertising the fact it wasn't vegetarian when I was in their Manchester bar a few days ago -- the bartender just casually mentioned it after I'd already tried some! -- but they're going to contact all their bars and remind them to make it clear in future.\r\n\r\nI also double-checked if they had any other beers which weren't vegetarian or vegan, and they said:\r\nAll our core range is vegan and vegetarian friendly and the only beer we produce regularly that is not vegan friendly is Dogma, as it contains honey.  Some of our one off and special brews sometimes contain ingredients like lactose or honey but these are included on bottle labels and should be displayed in our bars.\"\r\n\r\nUpdate via Twitter (August 2013):\r\n[https://twitter.com/brewdog/status/369763890252353536]\r\n\"There are a couple of exceptions due to the use of honey etc, but all core range are vegan. We don't do cask.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (January 2013): [specifically in regard to Punk IPA bottles]\r\n\"Yes this is suitable for vegans.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (January 2011):\r\n\"Our Bottled beers and Keg Beers are both suitable for Vegans as they contain water, malt, yeast and water. Our Cask Products contain Finings (as the settling agent) which have a fish derivative. \"\r\n\r\nCompany email (July 2010):\r\n\"Yes all bottles and kegs are vegan. Cask Beer, through the traditional hand pump contains isinglass finings which lets the unfiltered product settle in the cask.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email:\r\n\"No sorry none of our beers are vegan friendly.\"",

Aperol (April 2018) denies this, which is correct from their perspective, because they don't do the tests themselves (they'd be done further up the supply chain.) We're leaving this as green to be more consistent with our sugar policy (a better analogy might be that we don't ask what pesticides are used in the growing of raw ingredients, which would also likely be tested.)\r\n\r\nIf you're concerned about animal testing, we recommend choosing products that have fewer/zero chemical additives.\r\n\r\nCompany email (January 2013):\r\n\"Below is information that our sole supplier in Italy provided regarding the ingredients of Aperol:\r\n \r\nAperol is a liqueur obtained from an infusion of selected herbs and roots (orange, rhubarb, china, gentian and many others) in a hydro-alcoholic solution (water+alcohol). The colour is mainly obtained from these ingredients used to produce it.\r\n \r\nthe colorants used for Aperol are not obtained from any animal, they are:\r\n-Orange Yellow S, FD&C Yellow 6 or C.I. 15985\r\n-Allura Red, Food Red 17, C.I. 16035, FD&C Red 40.\"\r\n",

In addition, please be advised that our GREY GOOSE Vodkas do not contain any animal-by products or ingredients. \"\r\n\r\nUpdate:\r\nCompany Email (circa 2009)\r\n\"The creation of Grey Goose vodka begins with 100% fine French wheat from the highly coveted Beauce region, the Bread Basket of France. This wheat \u2013 a most noble and pure grain source \u2013 adds the same richness and flavor to Grey Goose vodka that it brings to the finest French breads and pastries.\r\n\r\nSpring water, originating in the Massif Central Mountains, the heart of France, flows into the Cognac Region.\r\nIt is naturally filtered through champagne limestone resulting in exceptionally sweet and pure water.\r\n\r\nThe pure grain spirit undergoes a five step distillation process.  With each step, the true essence and character of the vodka is revealed.\r\n\r\nFERMENTATION\r\n\r\nOnce the wheat has been ground into a fine flour, it is mixed with water and enzymes, which convert the starch content into fermentable sugars (hydrolysis)\r\n\r\nAt this stage, using a yeast bespoke to Grey Goose, the fermentation process begins.  In order to obtain the same fermented wheat, we closely monitor the temperature of the fermentation throughout the whole process.\r\n\r\nThe temperature is maintained by circulating the product in a loop with cold water\r\n\r\nDISTILLATION\r\nProprietary continuous 5-step distillation process\r\n\r\nFocuses on maximizing and concentrating the flavor of the fine French wheat instead of stripping out impurities because we only use the very best natural ingredients\r\n\r\nThe temperature of each of the five columns is continually adjusted to enable reactions to be triggered at precise temperatures\r\n\r\nThe distillation is constantly monitored by measuring the temperature and pressure in the columns and the quality of the high proof spirit\r\n\r\nPURE SPRING WATER\r\nPure spring water is taken straight from the ground and blended with the spirit\r\n\r\nThe water travels over 400km from the Massif Central to Cognac\r\n\r\nNo need for filtration - naturally filtered through the Grande Champagne limestone\r\n\r\nGives it a softness and natural touch of sweetness\r\n\r\nBLENDING\r\nUnder the supervision of the ma\u00eetre de chai, the high proof spirit is blended with the pure spring water until it reaches the perfect strength and optimal taste\r\n\r\nTHE WORLDS BEST\r\nGrey Goose uses the best at every stage of its production process from the quality of its ingredients to its bottling technology.  From the sourcing of the wheat to the moment a bottle of Grey Goose leaves its home in Cognac, a total of 500 quality control checks are carried out\"",

It is used as a filtration aid in the chill filtration process when we make all of our whiskies.\r\nThis is made into a paper that the whiskies will then be passed through.\r\n \r\nAs this material is made from fossilised algae it does affect the vegan whisky consumer.\r\nIf a whisky is un-chill filtered then you will have no problems with our whiskies.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (March 2013):\r\n\"No sherry will be treated in this way before it is filled into casks.\r\n \r\nThis would be the same for all of our whiskies so we are all clear on the vegetarian front.\r\n \r\nWe know this because we work with our forestry teams, coopers and sherry bodegas from start to finish and through these relationships we can monitor what is happening with every cask.\"\r\n\r\nNote from Craig (March 2013):\r\n\"Famous Grouse has Highland Park as a principle ingredient and all Highland Park is from sherry casks, one of the very few distilleries to do so.\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Famous_Grouse\r\nThe single malt whiskies used in The Famous Grouse blend include the Edrington owned Highland Park and The Macallan.\r\n\r\nHighland Park\r\nhttp://www.highlandpark.co.uk/lda/\r\n\r\nSHERRY OAK CASKS\r\nThe type of wood from which the cask is made is the most important element in encouraging specific flavours which give this single malt its own distinctive character. Spanish oak and American oak are both used to make casks for maturing Highland Park and each of these types of oak impart specific flavours to the spirit.\r\n\r\nMost of the Scotch whisky industry uses Bourbon barrels for maturation. At Highland Park Bourbon barrels are not routinely filled. Traditional oak casks are used; butts, puncheons or hogsheads \u2013 no barrels \u2013 seasoned with dry Oloroso sherry.\r\n\r\nThe oak source (American or Spanish) is of greater importance than the wine type. Spanish oak sherry casks give colour and dried fruit character whereas American oak sherry casks give vanilla and butterscotch flavours. Sherry casks are far more expensive but the view at Highland Park is that they are worth it for the character they give the maturing spirit. Typically, a sherry cask will cost 10 times as much as a Bourbon barrel.\r\n\r\nThe Edrington Group, proprietor of Highland Park, is the leading proponent of wood management within the Scotch whisky industry. It is estimated that up to 80% of the final flavours in bottled whisky can come from the wood. Sherry oak casks contribute to the distinctive richness and multi-dimensional complexity of Highland Park single malt Scotch whisky and are certainly a justifiable expenditure.\"\r\n\r\n\"No sherry will be treated in this way [i.e. fined with animal ingredients] before it is filled into casks. This would be the same for all of our whiskies so we are all clear on the vegetarian front. We know this because we work with our forestry teams, coopers and sherry bodegas from start to finish and through these relationships we can monitor what is happening with every cask.\"",

I received a personal email from an administrative employee who researched the matter.  She thoroughly explained that isinglass was indeed used for clarification of the liquid, and though it was filtered out completely with the impurities from the clarified whiskey, that yes, technically, that meant that it did not fit my definition of vegan.  She did state that that was the only animal-derived product in the process.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email:\r\n\"Thank you for taking the time to e-mail us. There are no animal products used in the production Jameson Whiskey.\"\r\n\r\nVia Jim:\r\n\"None of the products mentioned in the request for information below are used in any form in the manufacture of Jameson.\"\r\n\r\nIn brief Jameson Irish Whiskey is produced as follows:\r\n\"Whole cereal grains are milled, water is added and with the addition of yeast(a traditional type of distilling yeast is used) fermentation occurs. Fermentation is the process whereby yeast converts the wort, which is a sugary solution extracted from the milled cereal grains, into an alcoholic wash( in effect a type of beer). The wash, which contains about 12% alcohol is then triple distilled to give a newly distilled spirit. After maturation of the spirit in oak cask for the minimum number of years this beverage can then be called Whiskey. The production of Jameson Irish Whiskey meets with the strict requirements of the IRISH WHISKEY ACT, 1980, the purpose of which is to define the production and labeling requirements of Irish whiskey and blended Irish whiskey and all other relevant legislation on the production of Irish Whiskey. None of these regulations allow the use of such products.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email:\r\n\"Thank you for taking the time to e-mail us. Jameson is vegan friendly. None of the items mentioned [dairy, egg, or honey, bone char] are used in the production of Jameson Irish whiskey.\"",

We do not use any sort of sealants on our barrels.  \r\nOnce our whiskey leaves it's barrel, it is bottled either as a single barrel in the case of Jack Daniel's Single Barrel Whiskey or after being married with several other batches of whiskey in the case of Jack Daniel's Black Label, Jack Daniel's Green Label, and Gentleman Jack.  Gentleman Jack is charcoal mellowed one additional time as compared to Jack Daniel's Black and Green Labels. \r\nThere are no additives to our whiskies and no animal products are used in the making or maturation of any of our products.  If you'd like a closer look at how we craft our whiskey, we hope you'll visit our website and take our virtual tour (located under the Distillery section.) \r\nThis would apply to all our whiskies and whiskey liqueurs with the exception of Jack Honey which contains actual honey. Our ready-to-drink malted products are vegetarian, but not vegan-friendly since some of them also contain honey and they are bottled using the same machines.\"\r\n\r\nNote from Richard (December 2014):\r\n\"Not sure if this has been mentioned already but would avoid using Jack Daniels as they are a major sponsor of professional bull riding.

            "notes": "Company email (June 2020)\r\n\r\n\"For clarity we do not add animal derivatives into our products, however, upon a thorough investigation two years ago, we discovered that one of our sugar suppliers uses a process that is not considered vegan-friendly. While this is a common practice in the industry, it unfortunately also means we are unable to call our Kahl\u00faa suitable for a vegan diet...\r\n\r\n\"All bottles of Kahl\u00faa are mixed and bottled in the same place, Fort Smith, Arkansa, USA. Up until two years ago when the full production process was scrutinised we were under the assumption our suppliers did not use this method. Upon investigation we were informed that some of the affiliates of this supplier in North America uses the process. For us to be able to tell whether each specific batch is made using the process or not is extremely difficult and costly. Therefore we have the duty to communicate this to consumers, which is what we did and changed the status of Kahl\u00faa to non-vegan friendly.\r\n\r\n\"With that said, we have now started a process to ensure this is no longer the case and hopefully in 6-12 months will be able to claim Vegan again.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom their FAQ (https://www.kahlua.com/ca/faq/, retrieved May 2020)\r\n\r\n\"Kahl\u00faa Original and Kahl\u00faa Flavors are NOT acceptable for a vegan diet.\r\n\r\n\"Kahl\u00faa Ready-To-Drink (RTD's) are also not vegan, since they contain milk and/or milk proteins.\"\r\n\r\nVia Twitter (https://twitter.com/KahluaUS/status/808363210680180739) Dec 12 2016:\r\n\"Yes, Kahl\u00faa Salted Caramel is suitable for Vegans.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (July 2014):\r\n\"NO, there is no bone char filtering of the sugar.\" [http://contact.kahlua.com/org/kahlua/d/vegan-friendly/#c905882]\r\n\r\nFrom August 2013 on http://contact.kahlua.com/org/kahlua/d/can-vegans-drink-kahlua/#c345640\r\n\"We wanted to double check with our supplier who informs us that they use natural charcoal which may contain bone char. They go on to state no charcoal is present in the product.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (November 2012):\r\n[I contacted Kahlua just to double-check that the sugars used are vegan and not bone-char processed, and inquired about what they consider 'caramel color'. Martin replied very kindly (superb customer service) with this]\r\n\"Sorry for the late reply, I wanted to check with the chemist regarding your questions. Our chemist responded:\r\n\"The sugar is not filtered through bone char. The sugars used are considered vegan. We do not use white refined sugar. Caramel is also considered vegan as no components are derived from animal origin. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to ask.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the FAQ (December 2011)\r\nhttp://www.kahlua.com/ca/legal/contact/\r\n\"Kahlua and Kahlua Flavors are suitable for Vegans.  However, the Kahl\u00faa Drinks-to-Go (DTGs) and the Kahl\u00faa Ready-to-Drink (RTDs) contain milk proteins.  Therefore, they're not okay for vegans but okay for vegetarians.\"\r\n\r\nUpdate (2009)\r\n\"Kahlua Especial and Kahlua Mocha are also vegan. Company email: The Kahlua Especial is just like our regular Kahlua but the alcohol content higher. The Kahlua Mocha is a blend of 100% Arabica coffee, rum, natural vanilla and real dark chocolate.\" \r\n\r\nCompany email:\r\n\"The Kahlua Ready To Drink and Drinks To Go both have dairy. \r\nThe regular Kahlua, Kahlua Vanilla and Kahlua Hazelnut do not.

In fact we don\u2019t use any animal-derived ingredients or processing aids in any of our products with only a couple of exceptions and they are called out in their names (Apiary Ale for the Royal York Hotel uses honey from their rooftop hives and our milkshake IPA (also private label and very limited distribution) uses lactose).  Otherwise you are good to go.  Even the cane sugar in the Lemon Tea Beer or any sugar additions in our spirits are organic cane and so they are not processed with bone char like conventionally refined cane sugar.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (February 2018)\r\n\"We use no animal ingredients or processing aids in our beers except in very rare instances where we call out the ingredients (two beers, one is a milkshake IPA using lactose and one is a honey beer made with honey and both are only sold on tap in limited locations.  None of our core brands contain animal products and none of our small pack (bottles or cans) products contain them either.   All of our production is controlled by us and is made to our standards here so there is no risk of animal product ingredients or processing aids contaminating our beers.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (November 2012):\r\n\"Thanks for the kind words--our Cobblestone is something that we are all very proud of as brewers and the project to get it into Nitrogen-charged cans has been a focus of many of us for the past year so I'm very pleased that you like it!  All Mill Street beers are vegan friendly and we never use isinglass so you are totally good to go with our Cobblestone.  The only exception that we make regularly is our Royal York Stinger Honey Ale that we make exclusively for sale in the bars at the Royal York using the honey that they produce on the roof of the hotel.  The word honey is in the name so we think that is enough of a heads up to vegans out there and it isn't in wide distribution (only in their three bars).\"\r\n\r\nCompany email: Sept 2010\r\n\"None of our beers use animal ingredients or animal-based processing aids.  They are all vegan-friendly.  Our products are not made of exclusively Ontario sourced ingredients, but the bulk of what we use is Canadian sourced and we are moving toward finding more and more of it as close to home as we can.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email: April 2009\r\n\r\nWe do not use animal by-products in the manufacture or processing of our beers. \r\n \r\nThere is one exception which is our Milk Stout available only at our pub that contains milk-derived lactose sugar--this beer is a seasonal specialty that is currently available and won't be around for more than another month or so.  We named it \"Milk Stout\" on purpose so that it sends a very clear message to both vegans and those with lactose intolerance that it contains a milk product. \r\n \r\nWe do not use isinglass or gelatin in our cask beers--we do this intentionally so that they are vegan-friendly.  I don't know of any other breweries who produce vegan-friendly cask conditioned beer other than Mill Street.\r\n\r\nCompany email: April 2009\r\n\"Our Barley Wine is released annually in November.\r\nIt does not contain honey but does have some honeyish flavours from\r\nthe residual malt sugars\"",

The molasses ferment with the help of yeast and distilled in old oak pot-stills, just as it was done 300 years ago. It is then further aged for a minimum of three years in oak-charred barrels. It is 100% natural.  Our rums come from Guyana and Trinidad.

It is used as a filtration aid in the chill filtration process when we make all of our whiskies. This is made into a paper that the whiskies will then be passed through.\r\n \r\nAs this material is made from fossilised algae it does affect the vegan whisky consumer. If a whisky is un-chill filtered then you will have no problems with our whiskies.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (March 2013):\r\n\"'Our usual response re suitability for vegetarians, vegans and those with Celiac is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"We are aware of the condition known as Celiac disease where a person cannot tolerate a protein called gluten found in many cereals. Whilst the raw material for The Famous Grouse production will include barley, maize and wheat there is no gluten in the finished product as it is removed at the distillation stage. \r\nIf an allergy is oats specific then you can be assured that this cereal is not used in Scotch Whisky production.  However, our knowledge base is in whisky and not medicine so if in any doubt you should consult your doctor, pharmacist or dietician.\r\nThere are no animal products used in our whiskies so The Famous Grouse is suitable for both vegetarians and vegans. \r\n\r\nRegarding your specific enquiry, our Master Blender advises that fining in the sherry industry is carried out after the sherry is removed from the cask so no animal products come into contact with the casks.\"\r\n\r\nNote from Craig (March 2013):\r\n\"Famous Grouse has Highland Park as a principle ingredient and all Highland Park is from sherry casks, one of the very few distilleries to do so.\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Famous_Grouse\r\nThe single malt whiskies used in The Famous Grouse blend include the Edrington owned Highland Park and The Macallan.\r\n\r\nHighland Park\r\nhttp://www.highlandpark.co.uk/lda/\r\n\r\nSHERRY OAK CASKS\r\nThe type of wood from which the cask is made is the most important element in encouraging specific flavours which give this single malt its own distinctive character. Spanish oak and American oak are both used to make casks for maturing Highland Park and each of these types of oak impart specific flavours to the spirit.\r\n\r\nMost of the Scotch whisky industry uses Bourbon barrels for maturation. At Highland Park Bourbon barrels are not routinely filled. Traditional oak casks are used; butts, puncheons or hogsheads \u2013 no barrels \u2013 seasoned with dry Oloroso sherry.\r\n\r\nThe oak source (American or Spanish) is of greater importance than the wine type. Spanish oak sherry casks give colour and dried fruit character whereas American oak sherry casks give vanilla and butterscotch flavours. Sherry casks are far more expensive but the view at Highland Park is that they are worth it for the character they give the maturing spirit. Typically, a sherry cask will cost 10 times as much as a Bourbon barrel.\r\n\r\nThe Edrington Group, proprietor of Highland Park, is the leading proponent of wood management within the Scotch whisky industry. It is estimated that up to 80% of the final flavours in bottled whisky can come from the wood. Sherry oak casks contribute to the distinctive richness and multi-dimensional complexity of Highland Park single malt Scotch whisky and are certainly a justifiable expenditure.\"\r\n\r\n\"No sherry will be treated in this way [i.e. fined with animal ingredients] before it is filled into casks. This would be the same for all of our whiskies so we are all clear on the vegetarian front. We know this because we work with our forestry teams, coopers and sherry bodegas from start to finish and through these relationships we can monitor what is happening with every cask.\"\r\n\r\nChris says (July 2011):\r\n\"Just thought that I would let you know that Famous Grouse whisky is Vegan - They have a FAQ on their website which lists it:\r\nhttp://www.thefamousgrouse.com/Content/pdf/faqs.pdf",

Products have to be free of animal flesh, meat or bone stock, animal carcass fats, gelatine, aspic or any other products resulting from slaughter;\r\n2.      Products and ingredients should not have been tested on animals;\r\n3.      Products must be GMO free;\r\n4.      Products must also be free from cross contamination with non-vegetarian products/ingredients in the production process.\r\n \r\nWhisky production satisfies points 1 and 2, and given companies do not use GM sources of cereals and caramel also point 3.  This leaves any possibility of cross contamination by animal products as the only issue of concern. \r\n\r\nSuperficially, the potential for cross-contamination would appear to apply to Scotch Whiskies that have been matured or \u2018finished\u2019 in sherry or other wine casks \u2013 products that when bottled might have been \u2018fined\u2019 with animal by-products.  However, this is not an issue for Scotch as any \u2018fining\u2019 of these other products occurs after the casks are disgorged prior to bottling.  Scotch Whisky producers use the empty casks not the \u2018fined\u2019 liquid. Thus this last point is also satisfied. \r\n\r\nVegans can therefore continue to enjoy their Teacher's Whisky.\"",
