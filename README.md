# Barnivore Data

> This is an **unofficial** snapshot of a subset of the Barnivore database. This project is **not** endorsed by Barnivore and may not reflect the most recent data available.

[The Barnivore Vegan Alcohol Directory](http://www.barnivore.com/) maintains a database of company responses to enquiries about animal ingredients in their drinks. This data is duplicated here in the [`data` branch](https://github.com/DavidJones418/barnivore-data/tree/data) to allow for high volume access and further processing. See the [Update workflow](.github/workflows/update.yml) for details.
